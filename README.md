# Taschenrechner

A C# Windows Forms App exercise project, developed during my retraining as an IT Specialist in Application Development at Lutz + Grub Academy. This was my very first Windows Forms project, serving as a simple calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations.

## How to Run

To run the Windows Forms App program directly, launch `Taschenrechner V2.exe` located in `bin/Release/net6.0-windows`.

**The code was written independently by me. The class only provided a general idea of what the project should do.**
